# Build-your-own-Card
[because like the narcissists we are, we all like to have things that are fitted for us]

##WHAT IT IS
BYOC (Build Your Own Card) was created on a not-so-fun day with my final paper on the next day. I can literally do anything t excuse myself from studying, and I just got lucky that it was in the least bit productive.

It is a card written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can be edited to fill in the user's details.
** No data is stored on the server end. Every information entered is confined to the client's session storage.

The user can save changes, verify if the card is like he wants it to be, and then download the card as an image.

##TODO
- generate a better image which does justice to the design (top priority)
- options to tinker around with colors
- elimination of input elements
